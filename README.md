|------------|-----------|
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/tc_synth_num2_domestic_soundscape_000001.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Temporal Ordering | Easy (unique events=2) | Domestic | **Q1:** "*What immediate acoustic event succeeds the act of filling the glass with liquid?*"<br /> **A1:** "*The sound of a tap combined with liquid splashing and splattering follows the filling action.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*How does the occurrence of the tap and splatter relate temporally to the glass-filling event?*"<br /> **A2:** "*It happens after the glass-filling event; the tap and splatter follow in sequence.*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/tc_synth_num3_domestic_soundscape_000081.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Temporal Ordering | Medium (unique events=3) | Domestic, Human | **Q1:** "*Which sound event opens the audio scene?*"<br /> **A1:** "*The ticking clock sounds occur first.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*Which earlier event directly precedes the door squeak and slam?*"<br /> **A2:** "*The man’s speech/yell precedes the door squeak and slam.*"<br /><br /> **Q3:** "*Do the door-related noises happen before or after the man speaks?*"<br /> **A3:** "*They occur after the man speaks.*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/tc_synth_num3_domestic_soundscape_000217.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Temporal Ordering | Hard (unique events=4) | Domestic, Animal | **Q1:** "*What is the last door-related action heard in the recording?*"<br /> **A1:** "*Slam.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*Does the dog start barking before or after the sliding door sound begins?*"<br /> **A2:** "*After.*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/real_num1_PnF2Uh4oFfg.mp3"></audio> | Real | Temporal Ordering, Duration Reasoning, Acoustic Counting, Acoustic Understanding | Easy (unique events=1) | Industrial | **Q1:** "*What sound event is the very first thing heard in the recording?*"<br /> **A1:** "*The drill (power tool) sound.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*Compare the durations of the two drill events. Are they equal, or is one longer than the other?*"<br /> **A2:** "*They are not equal; the first drill event is longer than the second.*"<br /><br /> **Q3:** "*Which occurs more frequently in the clip, drill sounds or hammer sounds?*"<br /> **A3:** "*Drill sounds occur more frequently; hammer sounds do not occur at all.*" <br /><br /> **Q4:** "*Between the first and the second drill passage, which one is perceptibly louder?*"<br /> **A4:** "*Neither; they are virtually identical in loudness, so a listener would not notice a real difference.*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/real_num2_-6cTEqIcics.mp3"></audio> | Real | Temporal Ordering, Duration Reasoning, Acoustic Counting, Acoustic Understanding | Easy (unique events=2) | City | **Q1:** "*What audio event follows right after the end of the beep sequence?*"<br /> **A1:** "*The civil defense siren follows immediately after the beep sequence.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*Which event finishes the quickest?*"<br /> **A2:** "*The beep/bleep sound ends the fastest.*"<br /><br /> **Q3:** "*What is the combined count of all distinct events detected in the audio?*"<br /> **A3:** "*Two events in total are detected (one beep and one siren).*" <br /><br /> **Q4:** "*Which event is closer to a pure tone (i.e., more clearly pitched and less noise-like)?*"<br /> **A4:** "*The beep / bleep.*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/dr_synth_num2_machine_soundscape_000030.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Duration Reasoning | Easy (unique events=2) | City, Industrial | **Q1:** "*Which acoustic event occupies the greatest portion of the recording?*"<br /> **A1:** "*The chainsawing-trees event lasts the longest.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*Which event is the briefest in duration?*"<br /> **A2:** "*The breaking event is the shortest.*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/dr_synth_num3_car_soundscape_000128.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Duration Reasoning | Medium (unique events=3) | City | **Q1:** "*Arrange the three events in order from shortest to longest based on how long each one lasts.*"<br /> **A1:** "*Shortest: keys jangling → middle-length: engine starting → longest: engine idling.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*By how many seconds does the longest event exceed the combined duration of the two shorter events together?*"<br /> **A2:** "*It exceeds them by about 3 seconds (6.5 s − 3.5 s = 3 s).*"

| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/ac_synth_num2_domestic_soundscape_000054.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Acoustic Counting | Easy (unique events=2) | Domestic, Animal | **Q1:** "*Are there at least two doorbell rings present?*"<br /> **A1:** "*Yes*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*How many times does the doorbell (door alarm) sound occur in the recording?*"<br /> **A2:** "*3*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/ac_synth_num3_human_soundscape_000107.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Acoustic Counting | Medium (unique events=3) | Human, Music | **Q1:** "*How many separate occurrences of the snare drum are there in the audio?*"<br /> **A1:** "*Three.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*Do any of the listed sound events occur exactly once?*"<br /> **A2:** "*Yes, both the crowd and the trumpet each occur exactly once.*"
| <audio controls preload="none" src="audio/au_synth_num2_home_soundscape_000002.mp3"></audio> | Synthesis | Acoustic Understanding | Easy (unique events=2) | Human, Office | **Q1:** "*Which event is more likely to contain a richer harmonic structure rather than sounding like an isolated tone?*"<br /> **A1:** "*The speech passage is more likely to exhibit a richer harmonic structure.*"<br /><br /> **Q2:** "*Between the telephone ring and the speech passage, which one is louder on average in LUFS?*"<br /> **A2:** "*The telephone ring is louder.*"
